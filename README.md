# INF4000 Week 5: 
# Trouble shooting with Google: where the programming starts
![a](https://github.com/casszhao/INF4000.github.io/raw/main/debugging.jpg)


Note that this week is 
* **NOT** about advanced techniques and skills for R studio
* **NOT** about following each step and reproducing each result or graphs
* about practice solving problems **on your own**


Learning objective:

* To read error messages
* available source to start search for your bug
* examples



When see errors, do not panic.

Coders/data scientists, fix errors and mistakes, all the time. Today, let s talk about how to troubleshoot yourself.


After a while of coding, you will know how and where to start to fix the problem. Before that, you can try following general strategies to debug an error:


1. **Google**
 * Read the ERROR MESSAGE! Most error message does tell you what the problem is. Google it.
 * Many times it is a common error with a known solution. Sometime, even just copy paste your error message, you will find many people had the exactly issue like yours before.
 * Change a way to describe your problem if you cannot find the solution. 
 * Sometime, results from Google costs a lot of time to filter (particularly, when you ask in a not so good way), try other professional platforms, such as: stackoverflow, w3schools.com, codeproject.com

2. **Go back to your dataset**

Just check your data, even it is readable and loadable.
        
       
2. **Make it repeatable**
 * Create a minimal, reproducible example (e.g. reprex) using simple data
 * Note which inputs don’t trigger the error
 * If not already done, write simple tests to reduce chances of creating a new bug

3. **Figure out where the error is** 
 * Use the “scientific method”
 * Hypothesize, test with experiments, and record results
 * If needed, ask someone else for a second pair of eyes to review

4. **Fix it and test it**


These four steps should be followed each time you encounter an unexpected error in a function. Many times, you may not even know what line of code the error is coming from. How can you determine where the code is not behaving? You can follow these general steps to answer this question:

 * Begin running the code.
 * Stop the code where you suspect the bug/problem is arising.
 * Look and/or walk through the code, step-by-step at that point.

 This can be done ad-hoc in a separate R script containing the function code, or using several built-in tools in RStudio.


## Case study: Trouble shooting with via playing around

When debugging, do not afraid trying or playing around. Sometime you solve the problem unintentionally when you play around.


One question a student asked from last week: how to show a full range of coordinates.

![a](./coordinator.png)

![a](coordinator.png)

why the coordinate does not show "2020"?

Let s check the code 

```
ggplot(country_data,aes(year, NY.GDP.PCAP.KD.ZG) ) +
  geom_point(aes(colour =country)) +
  facet_grid(region ~ income) +
  labs(x="Year", y="GDP Per Capita Growth (annual %)",
       title='Faceting test', subtitle = 'Facet on both axes',
       colour="Country",
       caption='World Development Indicators, World Bank')+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(2000,2020,10))
```

If 

Let's check the "year" in the original dataset. We sort the

## Case study: Fuction
Next, let’s look at an example function.

Let s say you want to present the time distribution of your data via a nice visualisation. And you find a good reference that you want to do something similar with your data.
